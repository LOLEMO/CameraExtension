# Camera Extension for MIT App Inventor 2 📷

This extension provides access to camera functionality in MIT App Inventor 2 using the Camera2 API. With this extension, you can open the camera, start a camera preview, and stop the preview. 

I'll probably update this some day, but it's not in my timeline.

Feel free to fork/contribute it and improve it as you want.

## Features ✨

- Open and close the camera using the Camera2 API. 
- Start and stop the camera preview. 
- Display the camera feed on a `TextureView`. 🖥️
- Handle different screen orientations and transform the preview accordingly. 
- Requires camera permission to work. 🔐

## Compiling and installing 📝

- Compile the extension into .aix by using Niotron Extension Builder or similar.
- Add the .aix to your AI2 app (also works on other AI2-based IDEs)
